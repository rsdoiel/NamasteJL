# NamasteJL

This is an implementation of "name as text" signatures tools for 
directories. It was inspired by Michael J. Giarlo's Python implementation
of [namaste](https://github.com/mjgiarlo/namaste).

## Motivation for implementation

I thought this would be useful and simple to implement in 
Julia and to start evaluating Julia's usefulness in developing
software in a Library and Archival context.
